# IPE Stylesheets

Collection of IPE stylesheets, such as color palettes for different corporate identities, etc., to be used with [the IPE Extensible Drawing Editor](http://ipe.otfried.org/).

## How to add stylesheet to an IPE workflow

Choose from menu `Edit > Style sheets` (or hit the shortcut `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`S`), then add a new stylesheet by clicking `Add` and choose where the `.isy` file is located.

## Available Stylesheets

Stylesheets in [brown/](brown/) and [ucsb/](ucsb/) directories mainly defines color palettes which adhere to their respectively corporate identities. However, I am not responsible for any inaccuracies of the information in those files. I am also not claiming any rights to the designs or trademarks presented in those files.

In directory [legacy/](legacy/), stylesheets [svgcolor.isy](legacy/svgcolor.isy) and [x11color.isy](legacy/x11color.isy) store color definitions which are equivalent to those defined in [xcolor](https://ctan.org/pkg/xcolor) package in LaTeX. Due to limitations of how colors are available in IPE editor, these two stylesheets conveniently provides the editor an access to those color definitions.
